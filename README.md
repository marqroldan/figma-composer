# Composer
Mail-merge type of plugin. Generate personalized PDFs with Google Sheets

### Note / How-to Use
- Make sure to generate your own Google Sheets-scoped API key so you can access your Google Sheet file
- Headers will always be on the first row
- Make sure to rename your text layers to `%{header name}%` so it knows which one to modify
- Only Text layer is supported at the moment

Thank you very much to the owner of this package, https://github.com/brianlovin/figma-export-zip, because without it I wouldn't have had any clue that you can generate archives using only just Javascript
